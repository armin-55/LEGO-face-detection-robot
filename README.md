LEGO Face Detection with OpenCV and Python
Welcome to the LEGO Face Detection project! This project uses OpenCV and Python to detect and recognize LEGO figure faces through a webcam feed. The project compares live webcam images with pre-saved images of LEGO figures and identifies matches, providing real-time feedback on the detected figure.

Introduction
This project was built to demonstrate face detection and recognition using OpenCV's ORB (Oriented FAST and Rotated BRIEF) algorithm. It is designed specifically for detecting LEGO figures but can be easily adapted for other image recognition tasks.

Features
Real-time face detection using a webcam
Comparison with pre-saved LEGO figure images
Flexible configuration with threshold matching accuracy
Conditional recognition output to categorize LEGO figures
Easy to extend for new images
Installation
To run this project on your local machine, follow these steps:



bash
Copy code
cd LEGO-face-detection-robot
Install the Required Libraries: This project uses Python 3 and the following dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install opencv-python numpy and 3 another library 
Add Your LEGO Images: Add your LEGO images in the images/ folder, or use the pre-saved ones in the project.

Usage
To start detecting LEGO faces with your webcam, you can simply run the main script:


Command-Line Options:
Threshold for Recognition: You can adjust the recognition threshold to suit your needs:
bash
Copy code
python face_detect_webcam.py --threshold 0.8-0.3

How It Works
The project uses OpenCV's ORB feature detector to compare key points in the webcam image with those stored from pre-loaded LEGO images. When a match is found above a certain accuracy threshold, the recognized figure is printed on the console.

Feature Extraction: The script extracts ORB keypoints and descriptors from the images.
Matching: A FLANN-based matcher compares the keypoints of each frame with the stored LEGO image keypoints.
Recognition: The program prints the name of the LEGO figure if it finds a match above the defined threshold.
